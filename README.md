# Custom Flutter Architecture with BLoCs and Clean Architecture

Welcome to the Custom Flutter Architecture repository! This project serves as a template for building Flutter applications using the BLoC pattern and Clean Architecture principles. By following this architecture, you can create scalable and maintainable Flutter apps with a clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- **BLoC Pattern**: Utilize the powerful BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for managing state and handling interactions in your Flutter applications.
- **Clean Architecture**: Adhere to Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into layers (presentation, domain, and data) to achieve better code organization and testability.
- **Modular Structure**: Organize your codebase into modules based on features or domains to promote code reusability and maintainability.
- **Dependency Injection**: Implement dependency injection to manage dependencies and facilitate unit testing.
- **Integration with Packages**: Integrate commonly used packages for state management (flutter_bloc), dependency injection (get_it), and data handling (dio) to streamline the development process.
